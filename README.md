A terminal-based Python application divided into two main components:

- **Quiz Creator**: Allows users to create and manage quiz questions.
- **Quiz Game**: Lets users play a quiz based on the questions created.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. **Install Requirements**

This application uses two external packages:
- [`pyfiglet`](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/) – for ASCII banners
- [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) – for terminal color formatting

Run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet colorama
```

### 2. **Run the Quiz Creator**

```bash
python quiz_creator/qc_main.py
```

This launches the **Quiz Creator**, where you can:
- Add new questions
- Edit existing questions
- Delete questions
- Save questions to `quiz_creator.txt`

### 3. **Run the Quiz Game**

```bash
python quiz_game/qg_main.py
```

This launches the **Quiz Game**, where you can:
- Play a quiz based on stored questions
- View and save high scores
- Enjoy a styled interface with ASCII art and colors

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Design

Each file contains classes focused on a single responsibility:

- **Menus** (`qc_menu.py`, `qg_menu.py`) define menu navigation using OOP.
- **Managers** (`qc_question_manager.py`, `qg_game_manager.py`) encapsulate core functionality.
- **Handlers** like `qg_question_handle.py` and `qg_high_scores.py` abstract file reading and writing logic.
- **Main files** (`qc_main.py`, `qg_main.py`) initialize the application and invoke required classes.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure both `quiz_creator.txt` and `high_scores.txt` exist before running the game.
- The game reads from the **same quiz file** generated by the creator (`quiz_creator.txt`), so always create your questions first.

Enjoy building and playing your own quiz! 🧠✨
